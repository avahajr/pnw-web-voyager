# pnw-web-voyager


Final project for Privacy in a Networked World. This repository contains two Gen-AI based approaches to web-navigation.

The task is to find a data/privacy menu on a web page, so that the bot can click it and **automatically opt the user out of data collection, personalized ads, and the like**.

1. `gui-navigator.py`: a simple, text-only navigator that uses GPT to decide where to click
2. `PNW_web_voyager.ipynb`: multimodal agent-based approach, variant of the one described in the [WebVoyager paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13919) by He et. al.
